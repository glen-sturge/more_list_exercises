A menu based app I created to do 10 exercises for python programming class. 
The exercises were all based on list processing.
Below the plus sign break, is the set of questions as they were provided.

In some I've decided to prompt the user for input to create a unique list for processing.
In others I have used a sample list for pure demonstration of the code.

Also, I have limited myself to using syntax and functionality we have learned in class thus far.
No dictionaries, no additional modules that do the work, no list comprehension...etc

More List Exercises

Write a Python program that contains all the following exercises. These all contain lists and do
some basic numeric manipulation of the lists to provide a particular result.

1. Write a Python program to count the number of strings in the list where the string length is 2 or
more and the first and last character are same from a given list of strings.

Sample List : ['abc', 'xyz', 'aba', '1221'] Expected Result : 2

2. Write a Python program to remove duplicates from a list.

3. Write a Python program to print a specified list after removing the 0th, 4th and 5th elements.

Sample List : ['Red', 'Green', 'White', 'Black', 'Pink', 'Yellow']
Expected Output : ['Green', 'White', 'Black']

4. Write a Python program to get the difference of the sums between the two lists.

5. Write a Python program to get the frequency of the elements in a list.

6. Write a Python program to count the number of elements in a list within a specified range.

7. Write a Python program to convert a list of multiple integers into a single integer.

Sample list: [11, 33, 50] Expected Output: 113350

8. Write a Python program to find the items that starts with specific input character from a given
list.

Original list: ['abcd', 'abc', 'bcd', 'bkie', 'cder', 'cdsw', 'sdfsd', 'dagfa', 'acjd']
Enter the start letter: a Results: ['abcd', 'abc', 'acjd']
Enter the start letter: d Results: ['dagfa']
Enter the start letter: q Results: []

9. Write a Python program to remove consecutive duplicates of a given list.

Original list: [0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4, 4]
After removing consecutive duplicates: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4]

10. Write a Python program that converts a list and sorts it in both ascending and descending order
